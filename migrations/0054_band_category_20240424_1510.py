# About this migration: the fixed_fee attribute was half a solution.
# The full solution implemented here is to reframe the booleans "fixed_fee"
# and "base", along with an unstated default attribute "calculated", into
# a simple "category" field that can be used to control how the band behaves.

def migrate_base_to_category(apps, schema_editor):
    Band = apps.get_model('consortial_billing', 'Band')
    for base_band in Band.objects.filter(base=True):
        base_band.category = 'base'

def migrate_fixed_to_category(apps, schema_editor):
    # Why are fixed-fee bands being set as calculated here?
    # Fixed fees were previously set for individual countries.
    # Going forward, base levels can be set by country
    # (in addition to support level, introduced earlier).
    # So one old fixed-fee band is equivalent to a combination of
    # a base band for that country
    # plus calculated bands dependent on it.
