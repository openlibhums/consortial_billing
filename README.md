# consortial-billing
This is a plugin for Janeway that handles consortial billing.

## Development

You can get up and running with example data by running the management
command `install_example_supporter_data`.

## How the calculator works

This plugin powers the calculator we use to set fees for new supporters. We explain the maths in "[How the OLH calculates supporter fees](./how-olh-calculates-supporter-fees.md)."
